🚧 Sign Board Detection using YOLOv8
This project focuses on detecting sign boards (such as traffic signs or street boards) using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection model. The model has been trained on a custom dataset specifically created for this project.

📂 Project Overview
This repository contains:

A complete Jupyter notebook: Sign_board_detection using YOLOv8.ipynb

Code for:

Loading and preprocessing data

Annotating and training a YOLOv8 model

Evaluating model performance

Running inference on new images

Instructions to replicate the results or fine-tune the model on your own dataset

🎯 Objective
To build a deep learning-based object detection system capable of identifying and localizing sign boards in images using the YOLOv8 model.

📦 Custom Dataset
This project uses a custom-labeled dataset of sign boards.

🔗 Download the dataset from Google Drive

The dataset includes:

Images of sign boards

YOLO-formatted annotations

Training and validation splits

🛠️ How to Use
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-board-detection-yolov8.git
cd sign-board-detection-yolov8
Download the dataset from the Google Drive link and place it in the working directory.

Run the notebook:

Open Sign_board_detection using YOLOv8.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab

Follow the cells step-by-step to train and test the model

📊 Model Performance
The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as:

Precision, recall, mAP

Visual examples of detections on test images

📌 Dependencies
